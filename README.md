Python-Linear_Regression
Linear Regression is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the error_, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of _best fit. This code create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data. The line we will end up with will have a formula that looks like: y = m*x + b m is the slope of the line and b is the intercept, where the line crosses the y-axis.
